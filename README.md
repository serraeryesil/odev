# Online Education Platform - PostgreSQL Database FINAL Project 

This project was developed as part of the TurkStudentCo Data Science Bootcamp SQL Final Assignment. The goal of the project is to design and implement a relational database schema for an **Online Education Platform** using PostgreSQL. The database supports user registration, course participation, certification, and a blogging system for users.

## Project Scope

The database design covers the following core functionalities:

- **User Registration and Profile Management**
- **Course Catalog with Category Classification**
- **User Enrollments in Courses**
- **Issuing and Assigning Certificates to Users**
- **User-generated Blog Posts**
- **Timestamped activity tracking (registration, enrollment, publication, etc.)**

## Tables Overview

| Table Name             | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| `Members`              | Stores user profile and login information |
| `Categories`           | Stores course categories (e.g. AI, Cybersecurity) |
| `Courses`              | Stores course metadata, linked to categories |
| `Enrollments`          | Tracks which users are enrolled in which courses |
| `Certificates`         | Stores issued certificates for completed courses |
| `CertificateAssignments` | Links users to their earned certificates |
| `BlogPosts`            | Stores user-generated blog content |

All tables use **primary keys**, and appropriate **foreign key constraints** are implemented to ensure referential integrity. Unique constraints are also applied where necessary (e.g., `username`, `email`, `certificate_code`).

## üîß Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**
- **pgAdmin 4** (for executing queries and ERD visualization)
- **SQL (DDL & DML)**

---

## Files in this Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `online_education_platform.sql` | Complete SQL script to create all tables, constraints, and insert sample data |
| `schema_diagram.png`           | Visual entity-relationship diagram (ERD) showing table structure and relations |
| `README.md`                    | Project description and documentation (this file) |

---

## How to Run

1. Open **pgAdmin** and connect to your PostgreSQL server.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `education_platform`).
3. Open the `online_education_platform.sql` file in Query Tool.
4. Run the script to create the schema and populate it with sample data.
5. View the tables and try custom queries!

---

## Notes

- The schema is designed to be scalable and normalized.
- Sample data is included for each table to assist with testing and demonstration.
- The project follows good practices in database design: use of data types, constraint definitions, timestamp fields, and data integrity.

Thank you for reviewing this project!  
Feel free to explore the schema and extend it for advanced features such as quizzes, messaging, or admin dashboards.
